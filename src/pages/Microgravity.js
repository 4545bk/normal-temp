                The microgravity method, which detects both the lateral and vertical variations in the rock density, will
                have limitation over this site in terms of depth and resolution. In addition, the analysis and
                presentation of the results will be in the form of contour plots of the residual Bouguer Anomaly and to
                convert these into cross-section they need to be modeled but the solution are not unique, i.e. several
                models for the same anomaly as the cause of the low gravity areas are the cumulative effects of both
                shallow and deeper low density areas.
